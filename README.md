# HelloNeuralNetworks
summer project of 2023, a first step into the world of AI, all in C of course ;)

I hope to be able to show this off to my peers by the end of the summer

# Objectives :
> create a matrix operations header

> create some sort of csv loader

> create an interface to interact with the neural network

> (might do) create a text user interface so that there is no need to download SDL

> create a neural network

> create a system to train the network

> train the neural network on data to recognize drawn numbers


# Compiling on Linux :
Compiling on Linux is trivial, on most distributions you should only need to install the SDL2 library
```
Fedora : "SDL2-devel"
Arch   : "sdl2"

```
then simply go to the poject directory and type ```make```
an executable should have been created in the "build" directory if all went well.
